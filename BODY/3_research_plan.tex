In the previous section we established the potential of generated music in serious games (section \ref{section:motivation}), and the need of adequate time-varying controls over the generation process (section \ref{section:control}) to reliably ensure the usability of the generated music in the context of MACT. We identified inner metric weight \ref{section:rhytmic_weight} as a promising target feature for control, due to its established link to rhythmic entrainment, and perceived and observed difficulty for a player to follow the music. Additionally it is extends prior work on controlled music generation with a powerful rythmic feature that is interpretable, concise and calculated symbolically. 
We collected crucial technical considerations for music generation including overall approach in section \ref{section:non_neural_generation}, architecture in section \ref{section:deep_learning_generation}, representation in section \ref{section:symbolic_audio} and tokenization in section \ref{section:symbolic_tok}. Finally, we discussed promising methods of adding control to a model in section \ref{section:addingcontrol} and how to evaluate a model and its outputs \ref{section:evaluation}. 

The focus of the thesis will be developing a model that generates a complete musical piece with time-varying controls for inner metric weight. The output of the model will be investigated for successfull integration of control, for player enjoyment and for interactive potential in the context of MACT. 
  
\begin{enumerate}
\item{Research Question 1}: Can we effectivly control for inner metric weight in generated music?.

\item{Research Question 2}: Do shifts in metric weight provide a recognizable in-game cue?

\item {Research Question 3}: Does the generated music improve player enjoyment and engagement over Chalkiadakis\cite{Chalkiadakis_2022} rule based system. 
\end{enumerate}
