% THIS IS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF THE STRUCTURE
Music is essential in video games, enhancing immersion and engagement, but players may disengage due to excessive repetition or personal preferences. This is particularly problematic in games like LastMinuteGig, a Musical Attention Control Training (MACT) application for Parkinsonâ€™s patients. To maintain engagement and the effect of the intervention, a diverse set of controlled, adaptive music is needed. Advances in generative music offer a scalable solution. This research explores efficient methods of adding control to pre-trained models, to steer towards rhythmically adaptive music suitable for MACT. Insights from small-scale experiments will inform the application of rhythmic control in MusicLang, a transformer based music generator, which will be used to build musical assets for LastMinuteGig.
